      <p>You’re brilliant in the room. We make sure that brilliance survives deadlines, pitch decks, and delivery.</p>

      <p>
        Built for the way work actually happens — including mobile-first intake for trades,
        and capture-while-it’s-fresh workflows for brands and agencies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clyff is built around a simple belief: your best thinking deserves to survive the pressure of deadlines.
        It captures what matters early, then applies structure, judgment, and craft — so what you meant to say
        is what actually gets delivered.

  <!-- HOW SYSTEM -->
  <section class="section alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>How Clyff works, from start to finish</h2>
      <p class="intro">A quiet system that supports your thinking before, during, and after the pressure hits.</p>

      <h3>Ready to Work</h3>
      <p>
        When the opportunity appears, Clyff helps capture what matters early — your point of view,
        your experience, and the context that usually stays in your head.
        No long forms. No blank pages. Just the right questions at the right time.
      </p>

      <h3>Working</h3>
      <p>
        As deadlines approach, Clyff applies Quiet Genius™ — organizing raw input,
        separating signal from noise, and shaping your thinking into something coherent and persuasive.
        Your voice, sharpened — not overwritten.
      </p>

      <h3>Success</h3>
      <p>
        You review. You refine. You decide what goes out.
        Clyff supports the work all the way through — but you stay in control.
        The result isn’t just something finished. It’s something that actually wins.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- WHY -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Why Clyff is different</h2>

      <p>Under real deadlines, good thinking often gets lost.</p>
      <p>Notes get rewritten. Context gets stripped out. What sounded right in the room turns flat on the page.</p>

      <p class="emphasis">Clyff is built to prevent that.</p>

      <p>
        It captures judgment, preserves context, and applies structure — so your thinking arrives intact,
        not diluted.
      </p>

      <p class="emphasis">
        It’s the difference between something that’s finished and something that actually wins.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- WHEREVER -->
  <section class="section alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Wherever insight happens</h2>

      <h3>Trades and contractors</h3>
      <p>
        Clyff works on your phone — in the truck, between jobs,
        or at the end of a long day — without paperwork or back-and-forth.
      </p>

      <h3>Brands and agencies</h3>
      <p>
        Clyff captures thinking while it’s still fresh — often as teams leave the meeting —
        before insight gets diluted or rewritten.
      </p>

      <p class="emphasis">This is about timing, not technology.</p>
    </div>

  <!-- STEPS -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p class="intro">Four simple steps from opportunity to client-ready proposal or pitch deck.</p>

      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          <strong>Bring your past wins</strong><br />
          Share past proposals, decks, or project context.
          Clyff learns what has worked for you — not what works “in general.”
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Talk through the opportunity</strong><br />
          Share a few key details: the client, scope, timing, and your point of view.
          This can happen quickly, conversationally, and without long forms.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>See your thinking take shape</strong><br />
          Clyff applies structure and judgment to your input —
          assembling a clear, on-brand draft that reflects how you actually work.
          Not generic. Not templated. Yours.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Refine, decide, and send</strong><br />
          You review. You adjust. You decide what goes out.
          Clyff supports the process — but you’re always in control.
        </li>
      </ol>

  <!-- EXPERIENCE -->
  <section class="section alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Built from hands-on experience</h2>

      <p>
        Clyff was built from decades of hands-on experience shaping pitches,
        partnerships, and proposals — work that has helped bring in millions of dollars
        across media, sports, and brands.
      </p>

      <p class="emphasis">Quiet Genius™ comes from doing the work, not talking about it.</p>
