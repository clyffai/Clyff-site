<h2>How Clyff works, from start to finish</h2>
<p class="section-subtitle">A quiet system that supports your thinking before, during, and after the pressure hits.</p>

<div class="mascots">

<h3>Ready to Work</h3>
<p>When the opportunity appears, Clyff helps capture what matters early — your point of view, your experience, and the context that usually stays in your head. No long forms. No blank pages. Just the right questions at the right time.</p>
</div>

<div class="mascot-card">
<img class="mascot-img" src="./assets/working.jpg">
<h3>Working</h3>
<p>As deadlines approach, Clyff applies Quiet Genius™ — organizing raw input, separating signal from noise, and shaping your thinking into something coherent and persuasive. Your voice, sharpened — not overwritten.</p>
</div>

<div class="mascot-card">
<img class="mascot-img" src="./assets/success.jpg">
<h3>Success</h3>
<p>You review. You refine. You decide what goes out. Clyff supports the work all the way through — but you stay in control. The result isn’t just something finished. It’s something that actually wins.</p>

<h2>Why Clyff is different</h2>
<p class="statement">Under real deadlines, good thinking often gets lost.</p>
<p class="statement">Notes get rewritten. Context gets stripped out. What sounded right in the room turns flat on the page.</p>
<p class="statement">Clyff is built to prevent that.</p>
<p class="statement">It captures judgment, preserves context, and applies structure — so your thinking arrives intact, not diluted.</p>
<p class="bigline">It’s the difference between something that’s finished and something that actually wins.</p>

<h2>Wherever insight happens</h2>
<div class="two-col">
<div class="col">
<h3>Trades and contractors</h3>
<p>Clyff works on your phone — in the truck, between jobs, or at the end of a long day — without paperwork or back-and-forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="col">
<h3>Brands and agencies</h3>
<p>Clyff captures thinking while it’s still fresh — often as teams leave the meeting — before insight gets diluted or rewritten.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="note">This is about timing, not technology.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p class="section-subtitle">Four simple steps from opportunity to client-ready proposal or pitch deck.</p>

<div class="steps">
<div class="step">
<div class="step-num">1</div>
<div class="step-body">
<h3>Bring your past wins</h3>
<p>Share past proposals, decks, or project context. Clyff learns what has worked for you — not what works “in general.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="step">
<div class="step-num">2</div>
<div class="step-body">
<h3>Talk through the opportunity</h3>
<p>Share a few key details: the client, scope, timing, and your point of view. This can happen quickly, conversationally, and without long forms.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="step">
<div class="step-num">3</div>
<div class="step-body">
<h3>See your thinking take shape</h3>
<p>Clyff applies structure and judgment to your input — assembling a clear, on-brand draft that reflects how you actually work. Not generic. Not templated. Yours.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="step">
<div class="step-num">4</div>
<div class="step-body">
<h3>Refine, decide, and send</h3>
<p>You review. You adjust. You decide what goes out. Clyff supports the process — but you’re always in control.</p>
