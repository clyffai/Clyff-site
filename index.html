      <h2>How Clyff works alongside you</h2>
      <p class="intro">Meet your proposal strategist — supporting your thinking before, during, and after the pressure hits.</p>

          <img class="mascot-img" src="./assets/ready.png" alt="Ready to Work" />
          <h3>Ready to Work</h3>
          <p>
            When the opportunity appears, Clyff helps capture what matters early — your point of view,
            your experience, and the context that usually stays in your head.
            No long forms. No blank pages. Just the right questions at the right time.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mascot-card">
          <img class="mascot-img" src="./assets/working.png" alt="Working" />
          <h3>Working</h3>
          <p>
            As deadlines approach, Clyff applies Quiet Genius™ — transforming raw input into something coherent and persuasive.
            Your voice, sharpened — not overwritten.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mascot-card">

          <h3>Success</h3>
          <p>
            You review. You refine. You decide what goes out.
            Clyff supports the work all the way through — but you stay in control.
            The result isn't just something finished. It's something that actually wins.

  <!-- WHY -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Why Clyff is different</h2>

      <p>Under real deadlines, good thinking often gets lost.</p>
      <p>Notes get rewritten. Context gets stripped out. What sounded right in the room turns flat on the page.</p>

      <p class="emphasis">Clyff preserves what matters — your judgment, your context, your voice.</p>

      <p>
        Think of Clyff as your dedicated proposal strategist — someone who understands how to transform thinking into proposals that land.
      </p>

      <p class="emphasis">
        It's the difference between something that's finished and something that wins.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- WHEREVER -->
  <section class="section alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Wherever insight happens</h2>

      <h3>Agencies, brands, and sponsorship teams</h3>
      <p>
        Clyff captures thinking while it's still fresh — often as teams leave the meeting —
        before insight gets diluted or rewritten.
      </p>

      <h3>Trades and contractors</h3>
      <p>
        Clyff works on your phone — in the truck, between jobs,
        or at the end of a long day — without paperwork or back-and-forth.
      </p>

      <p class="emphasis">This is about timing and transformation, not technology.</p>

  <!-- STEPS -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p class="intro">Four simple steps from opportunity to winning proposal.</p>

      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          <strong>Bring your past wins</strong><br />
          Share past proposals, decks, or project context.
          Clyff learns what has worked for you — not what works "in general."
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Talk through the opportunity</strong><br />
          Share a few key details: the client, scope, timing, and your point of view.
          This happens quickly, conversationally — Clyff asks the right questions at the right time.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Watch your thinking transform</strong><br />
          Clyff works as your proposal strategist —
          transforming your input into a clear, on-brand draft that reflects how you actually think.
          Not generic. Not templated. Yours.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Refine and send</strong><br />
          You review. You adjust. You decide what goes out.
          Clyff supports the process — but you're always in control.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
