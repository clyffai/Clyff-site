        deadlines, pitch decks, and delivery.

      <h2>Who Clyff is for</h2>

      <div class="editorial-grid">
        <div class="editorial-item">
          <h3>Trades and contractors</h3>
          <p>
            Fast, professional, mobile-first proposals — built for the field,
            not the office.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="editorial-item">
          <h3>Agencies and brands</h3>
          <p>
            Pitch decks and proposals that reflect real strategy — not just
            fast output.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="editorial-item">
          <h3>Business owners and entrepreneurs</h3>
          <p>
            Stop rewriting the same thinking under pressure. Keep your voice
            and point of view intact.

  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
  <section class="section section-process">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>
        Four simple steps from opportunity to client-ready proposal or pitch
        deck.
      </p>

      <div class="process">

        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="process-number">1</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Bring your past wins</h3>
            <p>
              Share past proposals, decks, or project context. Clyff learns what
              has worked for you — not what works “in general.”
            </p>

        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="process-number">2</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Talk through the opportunity</h3>
            <p>
              Share the client, scope, timing, and your point of view —
              conversationally, without long forms.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="process-number">3</div>
          <div>
            <h3>See your thinking take shape</h3>
            <p>
              Clyff applies structure and judgment — assembling a clear,
              on-brand draft that reflects how you actually work.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Refine, decide, and send</h3>
            <p>
              You review. You adjust. You decide what goes out. Clyff supports
              the process — but you’re always in control.
